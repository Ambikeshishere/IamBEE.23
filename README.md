# IamBEE.23

A lightweight Python project that appears to load and run an intent classification model using a pre-trained classifier.

This repository includes:
- `index.py` — Main Python script to run model-based predictions
- `intent_model.pkl` — Pre-trained model file (pickle format)
- `work.txt` — Supporting text or dataset file
- `.gitignore` — Ignored patterns for version control

---

## 🚀 Features

- Load a pickled machine learning model  
- Predict intents or outputs based on inputs  
- Simple starting point for building intent detection or NLP-based applications

## 🧰 Requirements

Install Python (recommended **3.7+**) and the required packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
